## Ingredients
### First Phase
-  1 lb chicken breast
- 1 onion
- 6 cloves of garlic
- 1-2 red peppers
- 1 tbsp grated ginger
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 4 cups chicken broth
### Second Phase
- 1 can coconut milk (455mL)
- 2 tbsp peanut butter
- 2 tsp soy sauce
- 2 tsp sriracha
- 1 tsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp lime juice
### Third Phase
- cilantro
- vermicelli
## Steps
1. Place chicken in slow cooker. Don't turn on yet.
2. Slice onion, red peppers, and garlic. With olive oil, add to pan.
3. Add ginger and curry powder to pan. Cook until slightly soft.
4. Dump mixture on top of chicken. Add stock until covered.
5. Cook on low for 6 hours.
6. About 15 minutes before serving time, remove chicken from slow cooker and shred.
7. Add all [[#Second Phase]] ingredients, stir, and continue to cook.
8. Cook vermicelli separately. Aim for undercooked slightly.
9. When noodles are finished, add chicken back to the soup.
10. Lay noodles in a bowl, cover with soup mixture, then garnish with cilantro.
## Notes
- I like it more when there's a good amount of curry powder. A little cumin adds flavour as well.
- Feel free to be liberal with the [[#Second Phase]] ingredients, apart from the coconut milk.
