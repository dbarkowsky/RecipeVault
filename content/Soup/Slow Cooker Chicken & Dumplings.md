## Ingredients
## Stew
- 2-3 chicken breasts, roughly 1.5 lbs.
- 2 tbsp butter
- 2 (10.5 oz) cans of cream of mushroom soup
- 1 yellow onion
- 2 cups water
- 2 carrots
## Biscuits
- 2 cups flour
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 1 tsp sugar
- 3/4 tsp salt
- 1 cup milk
- 1/2 cup butter
## Steps
1. Place chicken, soup, onion, carrots, and butter in the slow cooker. Cover with water (expected 2 cups) and stir together. 
2. Cook on high for 6 hours.
3. 30 minutes before serving, mix the dry biscuit ingredients, then the wet ingredients and combine until well mixed.
4. Scoop small balls of dough, slightly smaller than golf balls, and add the to the top of the stew.
5. Cover and cook for another 25-30 minutes. At this point the dough will be cooked, and you're ready to serve.
## Notes
Could do this with any vegetables (celery maybe?), but I usually use carrots.
