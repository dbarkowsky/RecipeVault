## Ingredients
- 4 servings of spaghetti
- 6 tbsp of salted butter
- 1/2 bulb of garlic, diced
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup gochujang sauce
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1/4 rice vinegar
- cilantro and green onion, chopped
## Steps
1. Boil water and cook spaghetti to just under taste. It will cook a bit sitting in the strainer while we handle the next steps.
2. Melt butter in the pot we were just using.
3. Add garlic, salt, and pepper. Cook until softened.
4. Add gochujang, honey, and vinegar. Cook on medium-high until it reduces somewhat, about 3-4 minutes. We want this to be thick enough to stick to the pasta.
5. Return pasta to sauce and mix together. Add small amounts of water if too thick to stir.
6. Plate and top with cilantro and green onion.
