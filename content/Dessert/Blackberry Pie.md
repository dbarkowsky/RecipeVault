A pie recipe courtesy of my mom. The crust recipe was apparently from a Tender Flakes shortening box, but I prefer to use butter.
## Ingredients
### Crust
Note: This makes both top and bottom of a pie crust. Half it if you only want the bottom.
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 3 cups flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup cold water
### Filling
- 4 cups blackberries
- 1/4 cup flour
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 1/8 tsp salt
- 2 tsp butter
### Other
- egg or milk for wash
- sugar
## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 425 F.
2. Mix butter, flour, and salt together until crumbly.
3. Gradually add water and mixing until it is soft and holds itself together.
4. Roll dough out and place in greased pie tin.
5. Mix together all filling ingredients except the butter. It should pulp the berries as you mix.
6. Place the filling in the pie, then top with some small pieces of butter, distributed around the pie.
7. Place the top pastry, cut off excess, and crimp the edges with a fork. Cut slits in the top crust to allow heat to escape while baking.
8. Apply a wash of milk or melted butter over the top crust, then sprinkle it with sugar. This will create a nice sugary glaze.
9. Place in the oven and bake for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 F and bake for 35-40 minutes until browned.
## Notes
It's best to make this a day before and let it fully cool. It will hold together better that way, although hot pie is nice too if you're ok with a lot of juices.
