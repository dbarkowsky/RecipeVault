## Ingredients
- 1 medium can black beans (500g)
- 1/4 cup quinoa
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 bread crumbs (judge based on consistency)
- 1/4 cup yellow bell pepper
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 of a medium onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 1/2 tsp cumin
- dash of hot sauce
- 1 tsp salt
### For Assembly
- hamburger buns
- cheese
- other burger fixings
## Steps
1. Cook quinoa. Mix the quinoa and water together in a small pot. Heat to boil then simmer until cooked. You'll know it's done when the water is absorbed. It does not take too long.
2. In a large bowl, mash the black beans until they are a rough paste.
3. Add the cooked quinoa, bread crumbs, bell pepper, egg, onion, garlic, cumin, hot sauce, and salt.
4. Mix and form into 6 patties.
5. Cook like burgers from this point. Recommend using a skillet as they are a little softer than traditional burgers. You'll know they're done when they've firmed up and a slight crust has formed on the outside.
