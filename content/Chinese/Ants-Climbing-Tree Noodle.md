## Ingredients
- 400g glass noodle (sweet potato)
- 1lb ground pork
- sesame oil
- 3 large garlic cloves
- 1 tsp ginger powder
- 2 tbsp spicy fermented bean paste
	- OR 3 tbsp gochujang sauce (preferred)
- 1/2 tsp Szechuan peppercorn, ground
- 1 tsp white sugar
- 1 tsp soy sauce
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 3 stalks green onion
## Steps
1. Cook glass noodle according to package directions.
	1. Recommendation is to boil for about 8 minutes. They should be soft outside but tough inside still. Drain and rinse with cold water then add to main dish at later point to finish cooking.
2. Lightly brown ground pork in a small amount of sesame oil. 
   It should be slightly undercooked before adding other ingredients.
3. Add the garlic, ginger, and bean paste or gochujang. Cook for a minute.
4. Add peppercorn and sugar and cook for a minute more.
5. Add soy sauce and chicken broth. Bring to boil, then add noodles.
6. Noodles should cook to full like this. They will absorb the remaining liquid.
	1. Be sure to stir occasionally to keep them from sticking.
	2. If the noodles are cooked through but there's still liquid, remove from heat and let them rest to absorb the remaining liquid.
7. Plate the dish and garnish with green onion.
## Notes
