This recipe shows the toppings and how to prepare them.
For the pizza dough, use the [[Pizza Dough]] recipe.

A classic from the era when I worked at the Granada Restaurant.
## Sauce
Ratio here is about 2:1 ranch to hot sauce, but make to your own taste.
- Ranch
- Hot sauce (Valentina or Franks preferred)
## Toppings
- Mozzarella
- Chicken, diced. The original is breaded and fried, but let it fully dry and cool before adding to the pizza.
- Onion, saut√©ed
- Feta. Add after baking if you want it to remain un-merged with the mozza.
- Garlic
- Bacon, diced
