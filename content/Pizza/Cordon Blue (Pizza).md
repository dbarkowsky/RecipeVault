This recipe shows the topping and how to prepare them.
For the pizza dough, use the [[Pizza Dough]] recipe.

If you feel like this pizza needs a vegetable, consider asparagus. 
## Sauce
This sauce is a chicken b√©chamel.
It doesn't take much sauce to cover a pizza, so aim for a small batch.
1. Make a rue with melted butter and flour.
2. Add powdered chicken stock according to your taste. 
   If using liquid stock, balance this with the cream in the next step.
3. Whisk in cream, adding slowly until the sauce is the correct consistency. It helps to be a little on the thick side for pizza.
4. Add pepper and spices as desired. Recommend basil.
