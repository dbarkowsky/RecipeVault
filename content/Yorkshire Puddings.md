## Ingredients
-  2 cups all-purpose flour
- 4 eggs
- 2 cups milk
- 1/4 cup canola oil
## Steps
1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
2. Whisk milk and eggs together in a large bowl. Whisk in flour, 1 cup at a time, until frothy and well blended. Set aside.
3. Place 1 teaspoon oil into each cup of a 12-cup muffin tin.
4. Place the tin in the preheated oven until oil is smoking, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and quickly ladle about 1/4 cup batter into each cup.
5. Return to the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes until puddings have risen and are golden brown. Serve immediately.
