## Ingredients
- 2 shallots, diced
- Italian sausage (or chorizo)
- 2 tbsp. tomato paste
- olive oil
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 15oz chick peas
- 4 servings of pasta (recommend fusilli)
- salt
- parsley
- parmesan
- lemon zest
## Steps
1. Heat oil in pan and fry shallots until starting to brown.
2. Add sausage and cook through.
3. Add tomato paste and broth before bringing to boil and reducing to simmer for 15-20 minutes or until thickened. 
4. Add chickpeas and cook an additional 2 minutes.
5. Separately, cook pasta to taste.
6. Mix in parsley, parmesan, and lemon zest.
## Notes
- Sausages work great if sliced or crumbled. Your choice.
- I often use a dash of lemon juice instead of zest for ease.
