## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp butter
- 5 cloves garlic
- 1 cup sundried tomatoes
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 lb chicken breast
- salt & pepper to taste

2. Dice garlic and add to pan with butter. Fry until fragrant.
3. Add whole chicken breast. Sear on both sides.
4. Remove chicken breast to cutting board and slice.
5. Add tomatoes, sliced chicken breast, and chicken broth to pan. Simmer until the tomatoes are softened and chicken is almost fully cooked.
6. Add cream, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer until thickened.
7. Combine with pasta and mix together.
8. Top plates with parmesan if desired.
