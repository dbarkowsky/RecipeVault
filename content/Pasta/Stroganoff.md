## Ingredients
- egg noodles, extra broad, 340g
- 1 lb beef. This can be a steak cut or anything that doesn't require too much cooking to tenderize. I've even uses rouleden. The important thing is that you can get it nice and tender by the end.
- green onion, 4-5 stalks
- brown mushrooms, about 5, sliced/chopped
- butter
- cream of mushroom soup (284ml), the concentrated kind
- 1/2 to 1 cup beef broth
- 1/4 cup white wine
- 1/2 to 1 block cream cheese
- salt
- pepper
- (Opt.) 1/2 cup sour cream
## Steps
1. Separately, boil water and cook the egg noodles. They don't take long to cook and don't do well if overcooked, so plan appropriately.
2. Sautee the green onion and mushroom in butter until they begin to soften.
3. Add the cream of mushroom soup, beef broth, and white wine, stirring until mixed.
4. Reduce to a simmer and add the beef. Be sure not to overcook this. It should be cooked through and tender. If it looks like you'll have to simmer for a while to get the right thickness, delay adding the beef.
5. When beef seems almost done and sauce is mostly thickened, add the cream cheese and stir until incorporated.
6. When appropriate thickness, remove from heat and add sour cream if desired, salt, and pepper to taste.

## Notes
- A full cup of broth seems too watery. Has to simmer for a long time. 
- I think you could get away with 1/2 the bar of cream cheese, but I ended up adding more to help thicken.
- Some flour was still needed for additional thickening.
- No sour cream on the last version and it turned out great.
